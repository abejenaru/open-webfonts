## Download All Open Webfonts

You can download all Open Webfonts in a simple ZIP snapshot (/webfonts/ directory) from <https://github.com/nextgenthemes/open-webfonts/archive/master.zip>

#### Sync With Git

You can also sync the collection with git so that you can update by only fetching what has changed. To learn how to use git, Github provides [illustrated guides](https://guides.github.com) and a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GitHubGuides), and an [interactive learning lab](https://lab.github.com). 
Free, open-source git applications are available for [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows) and [Mac OS X](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac).


## Licensing

It is important to always read the license for every font that you use.
Each font family directory contains the appropriate license file for the fonts in that directory. 
The fonts files themselves also contain licensing and authorship metadata.

Most of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License, v1.1.
Some fonts use the Apache 2 license. 
The Ubuntu fonts use the Ubuntu Font License v1.0. 

The SIL Open Font License has an option for copyright holders to include a Reserved Font Name requirement, and this option is used with some of the fonts. 
If you modify those fonts, please take care of this important detail.
